\subsection{Effectiveness Evaluation}

To prove the effectiveness, we first load a \TheName{} kernel module on the Raspberry PI to prove the vulnerability.
Then, we burn the kernel with the defense on the same Raspberry PI and load the \TheName{} kernel module.

Once the module is loaded, the system will \textbf{hang} (or 
\textbf{crash}) since (1) it generates a translation fault or 
so-called as an \textbf{exception} 
(2) the corresponding exception handler asks to jump to the current address (in assembly language is "\texttt{b .}"), and triggers an endless loop.
The Linux kernel does not process the exceptions well in EL2 or EL3.
